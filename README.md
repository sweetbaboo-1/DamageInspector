# DamageInspector
Discord bot that uses the OPENDOTA API to retrieve and analyze the hero damage from the caller's most recent match.

Need .env with DISCORD_API_TOKEN='YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'
Need to create logs folder

TODO:
  * Add hero names
  * Allow for multiple matches to be parsed
  * Allow users to inspect the damage of other users
  * Allow users to add themselves to the ID list (will have to create a text file that gets written to and saved locally)
  * Allow myself to add new heroes (will have to create a text file that gets written to and saved locally)
  * Make Dino do the math part of this because I don't want to.
